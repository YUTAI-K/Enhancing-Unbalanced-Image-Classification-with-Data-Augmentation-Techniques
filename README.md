In this project, we evaluated the performance of various data up-sampling techniques for addressing classification problems on an unbalanced image dataset. For detailed information on the specific setup and methodologies, please refer to the term poster.


The code is produced by me, but I would like to thank my collegue Hangze Wu (hangze.wu@bse.eu) for helping with the writing. 


The image dataset we used is this one: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/deepsat-sat4.


The basice setup of the model (before grid-searching) was adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/code/dsrhul/agricultural-drought-prediction
